      <h4>Hackathon: (Cubing) HACKeD
      </h4>
      <p class="card-text">This course was my first experience with JS, so making Flashtime was my first app made with JS. In the making of the front-end of Flashtime (which was my segment of the project) I was introduced to the possibilities that JS could imply when combined with other technologies like Bootstrap libraries, HTML and CSS. This project had a significant impact on my learning because I was able to see how an app comes together, the process used, and how many components come together to create the final product. I can use what I have learned in this project to create similar projects to practice using JS incorporated with different elements.</p>

      <h4>Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This module was my first introduction to JS, and it was a great introduction which gave me a good foundation as to how JS can be used in illustration. The module started off my JS learning, which greatly influenced my progress throughout the course because JS was used in many projects which would have been very difficult for me had I not understood the Intro to JS module. As of now I have used the basic understanding of JS I learned in this module not to draw, but to understand functions and methods. This project is of a "meal".</p>

      <h4>Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This module gave an introduction to HTML/CSS and how to make webpages with them. This module influenced my progress in the course because on many other occasions I have had to create a webpage. As this is only a intro to HTML/CSS, I have a lot to learn beyond this, which I will continue to work on as a computer science student.</p>

      <h4>Responsive Web Design Certification</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This certification from Freecodecamp. I made two projects, one a tribute page to Helen Keller and the other a simple survey form. This certification was a leg up from the Khan Academy module, and I learned more about HTML and CSS. Still, since this too is only an introductory certification, there is still more for me to learn as a computer science student.</p>

      <h4>Natural Simulations</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This Khan Academy module provided a good tutorial on how to make natural simulations using JS. I made several projects, including the landscape above. This module helped me as a computer science student connect art and illustration with programming and helped me understand that there is a connection in how art can be used to learn computer science concepts. </p>

      <h4>Mathematical Rose Refactoring</h4>
      <p class = "card-text">This project was also my first experience with the p5 libraries. The projects I made include a refactoring of Dan Shiffman's Mathematical Roses and of the Metaballs. The Mathematical Rose refactoring randomizes the rose every time it is clicked and it shows the n and d value every time. The Metaballs refactoring is what I call a "cloud movement solumation" because it looks like clouds moving across the sky. This certification helped me learn about different javascript libraries that can be used to do unique things. </p>

      <h4>Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This certification from Freecodecamp helped me understand basic algorithms and algorithm scripting, which was the new content for me since I was already familiar with the data structures.  This certification helped me as a computer science by giving me a solid foundation and knowledge of algorithms and problem-solving. </p>

      <h4>Course on Algorithms</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This project was to teach others how to solve the Pyraminx Duo. My group created a lesson with activities and tips and tricks on how to solve it. From this project I learned the connection between a sequence of moves on a cube and a computer algorithm as being a series of steps and commands to carry out and see a solution/result.</p>

      <h4>SQL</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This Kahn Academy module was an introduction to managing data and making databases with SQL. This module helped me as a computer science to learn how to make select statements to get the data I want. I didn't find this module to be one of the more interesting ones, but it was useful nevertheless. For the future, I want to learn advanced SQL to manage large amounts of data if need be. </p>

      <h4>Games and Visualizations</h4>
      <p class="card-text">This module from Khan Academy teaching how to make games with Javascript was probably one of the more interesting anf interactive ones. I learned how to make games interactive and how to manage outcomes using JS. For one of my projects I made a memory game. As a computer science student I may need this knowledge in the future so I am looking forward to learning how to make more advanced games and visualizations.</p>
